## üïπÔ∏è Commands

| Command | Description | Permission |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| `/setwarp <name>` | Set a warp at your current location | `warpsystem.setwarp` |
| `/warp <name>` | Teleport to a saved warp | *(everyone)* |
| `/warps` | List all available warps | *(everyone)* |
| `/delwarp <name>` | Start deletion flow | `warpsystem.delete` |
| `/delwarp confirm <name>` | Confirm deletion within TTL | `warpsystem.delete` |

## üîê Permissions

| Permission | Description | Default |
|-------------|--------------|----------|
| `warpsystem.setwarp` | Allows creating warps | OP |
| `warpsystem.delete` | Allows deleting warps | OP |
| `warpsystem.*` | Grants all permissions | OP |

---

## üìÅ Data Storage

- Each warp is saved as an individual YAML file in the configured folder (default: `plugins/WarpSysPlugin/warplocations/`).  
- Configuration values are re-read at runtime when you run `/warpsysreloadconfig`.  
- Deletion confirmations are stored per-player and expire after the configured TTL.

---

## üß© Troubleshooting

- If warps aren‚Äôt being created or listed, make sure the plugin can write to its `plugins/` subfolder.  
- If sounds fail, double-check the Bukkit `Sound` enum names in your config. Invalid names fall back to defaults.
